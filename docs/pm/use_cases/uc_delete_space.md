# Use Case Specification: Delete space
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Show file structure
### Brief Description
The user requests to delete a specific space (given a unique spaceID). The server checks whether the session is valid, the user has access to a space (implicitly checks whether space exists) and the user is the creator of the space. If all apply, the server deletes all contents that are linked to the space.
