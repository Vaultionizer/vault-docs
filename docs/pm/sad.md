## Introduction

[The introduction of the **Software Architecture Document** should
provide an overview of the entire **Software Architecture Document**. It
should include the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations,
references, and overview of the **Software Architecture Document**.]

### Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the
system, using a number of different architectural views to depict
different aspects of the system.  It is intended to capture and convey
the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the
system.

[This section defines the purpose of the **Software Architecture
Document**, in the overall project documentation, and briefly describes
the structure of the document. The specific audiences for the document
should be identified, with an indication of how they are expected to use
the document.]

### Scope

[A brief description of what the Software Architecture Document applies
to; what is affected or influenced by this document.]

### Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

[This subsection should provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms,
and abbreviations required to properly interpret the **Software
Architecture Document**.  This information may be provided by reference
to the project Glossary.]

### References

[This subsection should provide a complete list of all documents
referenced elsewhere in the **Software Architecture Document**.  Each
document should be identified by title, report number (if applicable),
date, and publishing organization.  Specify the sources from which the
references can be obtained. This information may be provided by
reference to an appendix or to another document.]

### Overview

[This subsection should describe what the rest of the **Software
Architecture Document** contains and explain how the **Software
Architecture Document** is organized.]

## Architectural Representation

[This section describes what software architecture is for the current
system, and how it is represented. Of the **Use-Case**, **Logical**,
**Process**, **Deployment**, and **Implementation Views**, it enumerates
the views that are necessary, and for each view, explains what types of
model elements it contains.]

## Architectural Goals and Constraints

[This section describes the software requirements and objectives that
have some significant impact on the architecture, for example, safety,
security, privacy, use of an off-the-shelf product, portability,
distribution, and reuse. It also captures the special constraints that
may apply: design and implementation strategy, development tools, team
structure, schedule, legacy code, and so on.]

## Use-Case View

[This section lists use cases or scenarios from the use-case model if
they represent some significant, central functionality of the final
system, or if they have a large architectural coverage - they exercise
many architectural elements, or if they stress or illustrate a specific,
delicate point of the architecture.]

### Use-Case Realizations

[This section illustrates how the software actually works by giving a
few selected use-case (or scenario) realizations, and explains how the
various design model elements contribute to their functionality.]

## Logical View

[This section describes the architecturally significant parts of the
design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages.
And for each significant package, its decomposition into classes and
class utilities. You should introduce architecturally significant
classes and describe their responsibilities, as well as a few very
important relationships, operations, and attributes.]

### Overview

[This subsection describes the overall decomposition of the design model
in terms of its package hierarchy and layers.]

### Architecturally Significant Design Packages

[For each significant package, include a subsection with its name, its
brief description, and a diagram with all significant classes and
packages contained within the package.

For each significant class in the package, include its name, brief
description, and, optionally a description of some of its major
responsibilities, operations and attributes.]

## Process View

[This section describes the system's decomposition into lightweight
processes (single threads of control) and heavyweight processes
(groupings of lightweight processes). Organize the section by groups of
processes that communicate or interact. Describe the main modes of
communication between processes, such as message passing, interrupts,
and rendezvous.]

## Deployment View

[This section describes one or more physical network (hardware)
configurations on which the software is deployed and run. It is a view
of the Deployment Model. At a minimum for each configuration it should
indicate the physical nodes (computers, CPUs) that execute the software,
and their interconnections (bus, LAN, point-to-point, and so on.) Also
include a mapping of the processes of the **Process View** onto the
physical nodes.]

## Implementation View

[This section describes the overall structure of the implementation
model, the decomposition of the software into layers and subsystems in
the implementation model, and any architecturally significant
components.]

### Overview

[This subsection names and defines the various layers and their
contents, the rules that govern the inclusion to a given layer, and the
boundaries between layers. Include a component diagram that shows the
relations between layers. ]

### Layers

[For each layer, include a subsection with its name, an enumeration of
the subsystems located in the layer, and a component diagram.]

## Data View (optional)

[A description of the persistent data storage perspective of the system.
This section is optional if there is little or no persistent data, or
the translation between the Design Model and the Data Model is trivial.]

## Size and Performance

[A description of the major dimensioning characteristics of the software
that impact the architecture, as well as the target performance
constraints.]

## Quality

[A description of how the software architecture contributes to all
capabilities (other than functionality) of the system: extensibility,
reliability, portability, and so on. If these characteristics have
special significance, for example safety, security or privacy
implications, they should be clearly delineated.]
